# Deployment

## Release Notes
Version 1.0.0 <br>
The system is very bare, with very few to almost no non functional requirements being fufilled. <br>
The system depends on having a computer in order to collect the user's location or even have a preset one, however the map is still interactable. <br>
Issues include: <br>
- The location not defaulting to the city centre when permissions are denied <br>
- The heading and header not going across the whole screen and interfering visually with the search bar <br>
- The maintainers page not going anywhere <br>
- The types table not being aligned properly and the filters not working <br>

Describe the deployment of software components to hardware nodes using a UML Deployment diagram.
